| ------ | ----------- | -------------|
| Unable to connect discred bot to the discord | You are not logged in to your discord account | Double check that discord is logged into your account, and make sure to select the correct account and server you want to link to when linking the discord bot.
| Unable to invite your own bot using "Generated URL" in the 3-2 part | You did not add your bot before the step | Double check whether you added your own bot in the previous steps.
