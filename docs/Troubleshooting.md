# Troubleshooting
| Symptoms | Probable Cause | Action |
| ------ | ----------- | -------------|
| Unable to connect discred bot to the discord | You are not logged in to your discord account | Double check that discord is logged into your account, and make sure to select the correct account and server you want to link to when linking the discord bot.
| Unable to invite your own bot using "Generated URL" in the 3-2 part | You did not add your bot before the step | Double check whether you added your own bot in the previous steps.
| [macOS] Install and Updating Errors | Discord only supports MacOS 10.11 and up (El Capitan) or above | Restart your system or Reinstall via [this website](https://discord.com/api/download?platform=osx) |
| The bot replies slowly or after a long delay | Poor discord status | Check the [Discord status](https://discordstatus.com/) to see if anything is currently affecting messages |
