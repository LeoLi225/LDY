# Overview of Discord Server Customization Guide

Hello user, our guide on Discord server customization is meant to provide you with general guideline of creating and customizing your first server.

The things we want to teach you with this site include the following:
* creating a server
* adding custom emoji's on your server
* adding and using existing Discord bots onto a server
* creating your first Discord bot.


## How We Collaborated Together

At the beginning of this assignment, we were collaborating with each other during classtime. We used this time in class to brainstorm ideas and to flush out the details of our guide.

As a group we created a separate Discord server to communicate with one another. This Discord server also served as a place where we could share helpful tips and tricks in creating a user guide.

We used git and github to collaborate on this user guide. We each created a folder to keep our work separate to avoid conflicts with one another.

## How We Created Our Guide

To create our guide, we used various sources of documentation and applications. Our inspiration for this guide is our BCIT Set Discord server that utilizes custom emojis and Discord bots to bring more fun to the BCIT experience.

### Using Markdown

We were introduced to markdown as a simple yet effective method in creating a guide.

Though we were exposed to Markdown in other classes, it was to change one or two lines of text to input our name and student number. To write an entire guide with markdown required some trial and error to understand the syntax and formatting.

### Learning Best Practices for Web Writing

As developers writing user guides may just be a part of work routine. Developers may also write documentation for their peers and in the workplace. Being able to write clear and concisely is a valuable asset to have in the workplace.

We have attempted to maximize readability in our guide by breaking down a complicated procedure into bite size easy to digest pieces.
