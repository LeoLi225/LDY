# Overview of Discord Server Customization Guide

Hello user, our guide on Discord server customization is meant to provide you a with general guideline of creating and customizing your first server.

The aim of this document is to provide the user with direction with the following tasks:
* creating a server
* adding custom emoji's on your server
* adding and using existing Discord bots onto a server
* creating your first Discord bot.


## How We Collaborated Together

At the beginning of this assignment, we were collaborating with each other during classtime. We used this time in class to brainstorm ideas and to flush out the details of our guide. To continue communication after class, we created a private Discord server to communicate with one another. This Discord server also served as a place to share helpful tips and tricks we found with Markdown.

We used git and github to collaborate on this user guide. We each created a folder to keep our work separate to avoid conflicts with one another.

## How We Created Our Guide

To create our guide, we used various sources of documentation and applications. We found inspiration for this guide through our BCIT Set Discord Server. Someone had created custom emoji and added Discord bots that brought great joy to the server.

### Using Markdown

We were introduced to markdown as a simple yet effective method in creating a guide.

Our prior knowledge to Markdown was limited. We only edited Markdown documents to input our name and student id. To write an entire guide with markdown required some trial and error to understand the syntax and formatting.

### Learning Best Practices for Web Writing

As developers writing user guides may just be a part of work routine. Developers may also write documentation for their peers and in the workplace. Being able to write clear and concisely is a valuable asset to have in the workplace.

We have attempted to maximize readability in our guide by breaking down complicated procedures into bite sized easy to digest pieces. To highlight certain areas to our reader we have added the following icons:

A :smiley: indicate a user has successfully followed the steps given.

A :bulb: to indicate that the following information is important. 

A ‚ùó indicates information that the user does not want to ignore. If ignored it could be catastrophic.

## Conclusion

This user guide challenged our ability of communicating our knowledge of a software to a beginner. It was difficult to clearly state each task a reader had to do. We had to explicitly state each step. Leaving no step to be implied.

This assignment gave us the opportunity to approach a problem through the eyes of a beginner. It challenged us to consider what problems may a beginner face when they attempt to complete a specific task.

This assignment tested our ability to communicate. It was the first time we have worked as a trio. As a group, we continuously communicated with one another, especially when we faced difficulty. Through communication with each other, we felt less alone not only in this assignment but in the program in general.

Thank you using our Discord customization user guide. We hope this user guide was able to help you accomplish the task you wish to complete.
